   \textbf{Dissertation Abstract}:

   \begin{itemize}
   \tightlist
   \item
     In my dissertation, I seek to answer the question, ``What
     influences public compliance with public policy?'' More
     specifically, I ask, ``Why do people not comply with a
     shared-interest policy which benefits both government and public
     generally, like public health policy? Why do people comply with a
     conflicting-interest policy in which there is a fundamental tension
     between the state and the society, like taxation?'' I propose
     taking comparative trust and policy attributes to understand that
     different types of trust have reinforcing or counterbalancing
     effects on public compliance, and these effects vary across policy
     attributes. Drawing from 250 different survey datasets, I employ a
     sophisticated Bayesian IRT model, to measure four types of trust
     (trust in representative institution, trust in implementing
     institution, generalized trust, and particularized trust) and
     create a comprehensive trust data set covering 151 countries over
     47 years, from 1973 to 2020. To identify the causal effects in a
     panel data context, I use causal graphs and run a dynamic
     fixed-effects model with system generalized method of moments (GMM)
     estimator. I find that trust in implementing institutions has the
     most considerable effect on public compliance with vaccination but
     then the importance of political trust is at least matched by that
     of social trust on public compliance with taxation. My dissertation
     concludes that to break the vicious circle of public distrust and
     deadlock of policy reform, policymakers and policy implementors
     should rebuild public trust in preparing for governance challenges
     like future pandemics, infodemics, and climate change.
